# CodeGuru

This is a web-based application that integrates with Ollama's local API to create an interactive coding assistant. The application uses Gradio for the user interface, allowing users to ask programming-related questions and receive detailed responses from the CodeLlama model. The system maintains a conversation history to provide contextual responses.

Developed "CodeGuru", an AI-powered code teaching assistant using CodeLlama LLM and Ollama, featuring conversation history management and real-time response generation using Python and Gradio framework
Created an intuitive web interface for programming education by integrating Ollama's API with Gradio, enabling seamless interaction with the CodeLlama model for code-related queries
